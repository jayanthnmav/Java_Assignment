From Class_A, call/print an integer variable which is present is Class B. Where use constructor to reset the value of the variable from Class_A to Class B.

public class Class_A extends Class_B {
    static String pass = "Class_A_File";

    public  Class_A(int oneTime, String pass) {
        super(oneTime);
        this.pass = pass;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Class_B.oneTime);


    }
}
